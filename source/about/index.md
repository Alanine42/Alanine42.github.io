I am a quick learner with a creative mind. I build software that makes people's lives a bit more interesting. Whether it's a music app that syncs tempo to the user's running rhythm, or a web app that uses graph algorithms to help new students explore various pathways in their major, I enjoy the process of learning new technologies and building things from scratch.
